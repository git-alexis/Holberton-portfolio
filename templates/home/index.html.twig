	<h1 class="center">World War II Tanks</h1>

    <p>Tanks played a crucial role during World War II. Each nation involved in the conflict developed and used various tank models, each with its own characteristics and strategies of use.</p>
    <p>Tanks are armored vehicles equipped with cannons and other weapons, designed to combine strong firepower, armored protection, and sufficient mobility to traverse different battlefields.</p>

    <h2 class="center">Most common types of Tanks</h2>
    
    <h3>Light Tanks</h3>
    <p>Light tanks are fast and maneuverable, but they are lightly armored and armed. They were primarily used for reconnaissance and infantry support. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>M3 Stuart (USA)</li>
        <li>Panzer II (Germany)</li>
        <li>T-70 (Soviet Union)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Medium Tanks</h3>
    <p>Medium tanks offer a good balance between firepower, armor, and mobility. They were used for versatile roles on the battlefield. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>M4 Sherman (USA)</li>
        <li>Panzer IV (Germany)</li>
        <li>T-34 (Soviet Union)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Heavy Tanks</h3>
    <p>Heavy tanks are heavily armored and powerfully armed, but they are less mobile. They were used to break through enemy lines and engage other heavy tanks. Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tiger I (Germany)</li>
        <li>Churchill (UK)</li>
        <li>KV-1 (Soviet Union)</li>
    </ul>
